## Software Development Plan

This application is a programmatic implementation of draughts with the Ruby programming language. It allows two players to engage in a game of draughts electronically via the terminal.

This application was developed in order to test my learned skills in the Ruby programming language to date, in particular, to expand upon my understanding of Object Oriented Programming.

The target audience of this program is anyone who wishes to be entertained, it is intended as a recreational aid. It is perfect for someone who wishes to play a game of draughts with a friend, but does not have access to the board game.

## Application Features

- Play a two person game of draughts in the terminal
- View previous game history and total win count for black versus red
- How to play instructions
- Launch new games and previous game history through the terminal via command line arguments
